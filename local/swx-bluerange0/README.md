## dm creation

    docker-machine create -d generic --generic-ip-address 172.109.143.74 --generic-ssh-port 20022 --generic-ssh-key ${devops}/secrets/ssh/sofwerx --generic-ssh-user swxadmin --generic-engine-port 20376 --engine-storage-driver overlay2 swx-u-ub-bluerange0
    swx dm import swx-u-ub-bluerange0

## authentication

If you pass a base64 encoded `ELASTICSEARCH_LICENSE` to setup a basic license, you will lose XPack authentication. This is why there is a `traefik.frontend.auth.basic` label in place.

The `ELASTIC_PASSWORD_APR1` environment variable needs to be an apr1 salted hash password, generated by:

    swx environment set ELASTIC_PASSWORD_APR1 "$(openssl passwd -apr1 $ELASTIC_PASSWORD)"

If you change the `ELASTIC_PASSWORD`, remember to change the `ELASTIC_PASSWORD_APR1` as well.
